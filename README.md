### `npm install`

Install all the dependencies

### `npm run start`

Run this in the main folder **"./Search App"**

Both React Scripts and the Node JS will start concurrently.

Once the React App opens you can type in any keyword in the search bar and it will show you the corresponding result.

For the Project I have used:

1. Redux
2. React
3. MongoDB
4. Express
5. Materialize for prebuilt CSS components
